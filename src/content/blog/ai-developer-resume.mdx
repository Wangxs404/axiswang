# From Aerospace Engineering to AI Development: My Journey Building AI Products

*How I transitioned from designing jet engines to building AI products that thousands use every day — and why I'm ready for my next challenge as an AI Developer.*

---

## Introduction

Two years ago, I was designing turbojet engines at the China Academy of Aerospace Technology. Today, I'm a full-stack AI developer with a PhD from Tsinghua University, having built multiple AI products that serve thousands of users.

This isn't just a career change — it's a complete transformation in how I create value. I don't just write code; I build AI systems that solve real problems. My background in aerospace engineering taught me to think systematically, optimize under constraints, and deliver reliable results under pressure. Now, I'm applying those same principles to AI development.

If you're looking for an AI developer who can take your product from concept to production — someone who understands both the mathematics and the business impact — let's talk.

## Why I'm the AI Developer You're Looking For

### 🎯 I Build Production-Ready AI Systems

I'm not just a prompt engineer or a researcher who stays in the lab. I build full-stack AI applications that users actually use:

- **End-to-end development**: From data pipelines to user-facing interfaces
- **Scalable architecture**: Experience with cloud infrastructure, APIs, and real-world deployment
- **Multimodal AI**: Expertise in combining LLM, computer vision, and speech processing

### 🧠 Deep Technical Foundation

My academic background gives me a unique advantage:

- **PhD in Ocean Engineering** from Tsinghua University (China's top university)
- **Published 3 research papers** in peer-reviewed journals (Physics of Fluids, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer)
- **4 patents** in fluid dynamics and energy systems
- **Expertise in**: C++, Python, PyTorch, CUDA, numerical simulation

### 🚀 Product Mindset

I don't just optimize models — I optimize business outcomes:

- Built 3 AI products from scratch to launch
- Won multiple hackathons (ByteDance AI for Coding 1st Prize, Amazon China Summit Best Tool)
- Experience with rapid prototyping and user feedback loops
